# **DARIAH resources pathways** {#dariah-resources-pathways}

Different pathways are available to add resources to the EU landscape and DARIAH environment. This section details, for six main content types \- services, data sources, software, publications, datasets and training materials \- what are these different options, and what kind of questions can guide one to decide on the best pathway for their resources.

Obviously, depending on the role an actor has (resource creator, service provider, process owner…), its interests in DARIAH pathways might differ. For example, a repository manager will not have the same perspective to integrate the data source they are responsible for than a researcher willing to share a dataset they have created during a research project funded under the DARIAH theme. These guidelines are covering most of the use cases encountered by the DARIAH community so far, but can and should be extended to encompass new resource types or additional activities carried out by the various actors.

| Resource Type | Corresponding Services | Pathways (1,2 \= sequence, A,B,C \= alternative options) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Service | [SSH Open Marketplace](#ssh-open-marketplace) [DARIAH tools & services catalogue](https://www.dariah.eu/tools-services/tools-and-services/) | Onboard the service in the SSH Open Marketplace.  Service is (automatically) listed in the [DARIAH tools & services catalogue](https://www.dariah.eu/tools-services/tools-and-services/) |
| Data source | [DARIAH OpenAire Community Gateway](#dariah-openaire-gateway) [SSH Open Marketplace](#ssh-open-marketplace) [DARIAH Campus](#dariah-campus) | Depending on the content types a data source hosts, the options are:  if the data source hosts or aggregates mostly publications and/or dataset, it should disseminate the metadata in the DARIAH OpenAire Community Gateway. If the data source exposes metadata about services, software and tools, the products should be available in the SSH Open Marketplace (automated pipeline or manual addition). The products should clearly indicate their relation to relevant services, software and tools. If the data source hosts training materials, the products should be added to DARIAH Campus as external resources.  |
| Software | [Zenodo (DARIAH Community)](#zenodo-\(dariah-community\)) ; [Software Heritage](#software-heritage) | Pre-condition: software code needs to be available online. For example, use Zenodo (DARIAH Community) or GitHub Adding metadata about your software to the [SSH Open Marketplace]().  |
| Publication | [DARIAH recommended repositories](#dariah-recommended-repositories) [DARIAH Zotero Library](#dariah-zotero-library) [DARIAH OpenAire Community Gateway](#dariah-openaire-gateway) [Transformations. A DARIAH Journal](#dariah-overlay-journal---transformations)  | Pre-condition: publication is deposited or published (see here for the list of DARIAH recommended repositories).  Add the bibliographical record to the DARIAH Zotero library. All DARIAH publications should be added to this DARIAH Zotero library If it has a PID, link the publication to the DARIAH OpenAire Community Gateway Submit publication for peer review in [*Transformations. A DARIAH Journal*](https://transformations.episciences.org/)  |
| Dataset | [DARIAH recommended repositories](#dariah-recommended-repositories) [HAL DARIAH](https://hal.science/DARIAH) or [Zenodo (DARIAH Community)](#zenodo-\(dariah-community\))  [Transformations. A DARIAH Journal](#dariah-overlay-journal---transformations) | Deposit your work in a repositoryA) Ideally a DARIAH recommended repositoryB) HAL or ZenodoC) any other institutional repository which issues PIDs Link your dataset to the DARIAH OpenAire Community Gateway If suitable, submit publication for peer review in *Transformations. A DARIAH Journal* |
| Training Material | [DARIAH Campus](#dariah-campus) [SSH Open Marketplace](#ssh-open-marketplace) | Create training material directly in DARIAH Campus  Create in DARIAH-Campus a reference page for a resource available in another system (institutional/national or discipline specific LMS/e-learning system ) If the material is not suitable for DARIAH Campus, add it as training material to the SSH Open Marketplace |
| Other (digital) resources, such as: notebooks, semantic artefacts, standards, workflows… | [SSH Open Marketplace](#ssh-open-marketplace) [DARIAH OpenAire Community Gateway](#dariah-openaire-gateway) [Transformations. A DARIAH Journal](#dariah-overlay-journal---transformations) | Register the resourceA) as “tools & services” in the SSH Open MarketplaceB) link your resource to the DARIAH OpenAire Community Gateway OpenAire  If suitable, submit publication for peer review in *Transformations. A DARIAH Journal Narrative workflows may also be created directly in the SSH Open Marketplace* |
