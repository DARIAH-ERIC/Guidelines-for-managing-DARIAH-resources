These guidelines primarily intend to give recommendations and practical advice on how to make resources become part of \[the\] DARIAH \[offer\], and as such how these resources can extend/enrich the DARIAH Infrastructure at large.[^1] These recommendations are primarily geared towards DARIAH National Coordinators declaring/managing their national resources. However, they may also be useful and used by any other DARIAH related actors (Working Group chairs or members, recipients of the DARIAH Funding Scheme, members of other DARIAH bodies, such as the Joint Research Committee or the Scientific Board) interested in integrating assets in the DARIAH environment. These guidelines were developed to accompany the Unified National Report (UNRs), explaining not how to report (this is covered directly by the UNR), but **how to manage resources in the DARIAH ecosystem**. To achieve this, specific "pathways” are proposed, which allow the flow of information about the resources from existing data sources of the broader ecosystem, eliminating the need to enter the same information multiple times.

Complementing the dedicated policy documents, these guidelines detail for each resource type \- service, data sources, software, publications, datasets, training materials \- **what are the possible pathways one should follow to ensure their resources become part of the DARIAH offer** (section 1\) and what are the main services used as part of the pathways to manage DARIAH resources (section 2). Diagrams presented in annexes illustrate the various pathways per resource type, showing which sources of information are considered and how the information flow between registering and reporting DARIAH resources is envisioned. These guidelines should be used as reference and are not meant to be read in full at once.
