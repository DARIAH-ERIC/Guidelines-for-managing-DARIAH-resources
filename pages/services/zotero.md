## DARIAH Zotero Library

DARIAH maintains a Zotero Group Library \- [https://www.zotero.org/groups/744474/dariah/library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/744474/dariah/library) \- in which DARIAH publications are being compiled. It is structured into collections per DARIAH member country and per DARIAH Working Groups.

Zotero comes with a good documentation \- [https://www.zotero.org/support/](https://www.zotero.org/support/) \- so the following guidelines only highlight the specific steps on how to add DARIAH national resources to Zotero, pointing to the existing documentation where necessary.
