## DARIAH recommended repositories

According to the [DARIAH Data Policy](https://zenodo.org/records/14515142), we recommend using an institutional repository, if available and if required by your institutional data sharing policies, or, alternatively use: 

* one of the DARIAH affiliated repositories (section 3.2.1),   
* DARIAH HAL collection (section 3.2.2)   
* DARIAH Zenodo Community (section 3.2.3)

  1. ### DARIAH repositories 

DARIAH members and partners contribute to the DARIAH infrastructure with a diverse range of resources, most known data sources are repositories and are services declared by DARIAH National Coordinators. All [DARIAH repositories](https://www.dariah.eu/tools-services/tools-and-services/?tab=dh-tab-1&categories%5B%5D=repository&searchStr=) can be found browsing the DARIAH service catalogue.

2. ### HAL (DARIAH Collection)

DARIAH offers researchers in the arts and humanities to use the HAL **publication repository**: [**https://hal.science/DARIAH**](https://hal.science/DARIAH).

1. #### Log in to [HAL DARIAH collection](https://hal.science/DARIAH)

If you already have a HAL account, sign in to [https://hal.science/DARIAH](https://hal.science/DARIAH). If it is the first time you use HAL, you will need to create an account: [https://hal.science/user/create](https://hal.science/user/create). 

2. #### Upload and describe resource

Click on UPLOAD (top right of your screen), choose your document type and provide metadata about the resource

 ![image3](../images/image11.png)

3. #### Add ‘DARIAH’ to Project collaboration metadata field

Whatever the type of document, you will find this field in “In Other informations”.

 ![image3](../images/image14.png)

You can also add or create your DARIAH national Project/Collaboration to your deposit (e.g DARIAH-BE, DARIAH-CH, DARIAH-HR…).

3. ### Zenodo (DARIAH Community)

The DARIAH Zenodo Community \- [**https://zenodo.org/communities/dariah/**](https://zenodo.org/communities/dariah/) \- brings together and accepts outputs (partially or entirely) of collaborations within and across the DARIAH networks (such as the DARIAH Working Groups, Theme funding calls or National Consortia), or contributions that are related to DARIAH’s activities in any other way.

Submissions to the community require review performed by the curators, managers or owners (i.e. DARIAH DCO team members) of the community.

1. #### Log in to [**DARIAH Zenodo Community**](https://zenodo.org/communities/dariah/)

 ![image3](../images/image12.png)

2. #### And then simply go to **New upload**, and here, you will have to login to Zenodo ![][image6]

3. #### Select DARIAH as Community

   If you connect directly to Zenodo (generic), you will have to select DARIAH in the communities banner at the top of the upload screen.

 ![image3](/..images/image23.png)

You will have to write DARIAH in full \- Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities \- and not only the acronym.

 ![image3](../images/image29.png)

Note that you can add multiple communities to your deposits at the same time.

If you would like to add records to the DARIAH collection that are already published on Zenodo, you should go to ‘Upload’ and then click on the record(s) you would like to add to the DARIAH community. Unfortunately, if you are not the depositor of the record, you will not be able to modify it even if you are one of the authors.

#### 

#### Publishing a software from GitHub to Zenodo

By following this [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content) \- it is possible to archive a GitHub repository to Zenodo.

 ![image3](../images/image7.png)

Then, in the same way that for any Zenodo deposit (see previous section), you will be able to select the DARIAH community when creating the record for the release of your software. 

3. ## DARIAH overlay journal \- Transformations

*Transformations. A DARIAH Journal* is a multilingual journal created in 2024 by DARIAH ERIC, and available at: [**https://transformations.episciences.org/**](https://transformations.episciences.org/). It publishes one issue per yearand offers the possibility for authors to submit a diversity of research outputs: research article, data paper and workflow paper. Both authors and reviewers can rely on some thorough [guidelines](https://transformations.episciences.org/for-authors#evaluation-and-guidelines) for submitting and assessing these different outputs

In *Transformations*, Arts and humanities researchers can publish in a transparent publishing model based on DIAMOND Open Access and Open Peer Review, for documenting different types of methodological and research activities (data gathering and processing, annotation, modelling, analysis and interpretation) as well as diverse and complex research outputs (the scholarly paper, the underlying data or other resources, software packages, training materials etc.).

An **overlay journal** is an innovative type of scholarly publication that operates on top of pre-existing data repositories. Unlike traditional journals, overlay journals do not host content themselves. Instead, they select, peer review and formally publish links to content that is already hosted on other platforms, such as [HAL](https://shs.hal.science/) , Zenodo or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) and [ARCHE](https://arche.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/browser/) (recently connected to Episciences). Articles, or any type of content that has been selected for publication, receives a proper citation and a digital object identifier (DOI), ​​making it possible for readers to reference and link to these documents reliably.

Step by step, the goal is for DARIAH to **connect DARIAH recommended repositories** to Episciences, enabling a wider number of repositories to feed into the overlay journal. 

4. ## DARIAH Zotero Library {#dariah-zotero-library}

DARIAH maintains a Zotero Group Library \- [https://www.zotero.org/groups/744474/dariah/library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/744474/dariah/library) \- in which DARIAH publications are being compiled. It is structured into collections per DARIAH member country and per DARIAH Working Groups.

Zotero comes with a good documentation \- [https://www.zotero.org/support/](https://www.zotero.org/support/) \- so the following guidelines only highlight the specific steps on how to add DARIAH national resources to Zotero, pointing to the existing documentation where necessary.

1. ### Log in or register to Zotero

If you already have a Zotero account, log in via [https://www.zotero.org/user/login/](https://www.zotero.org/user/login/). If it is the first time you use Zotero, you will need to create an account: [https://www.zotero.org/user/register](https://www.zotero.org/user/register). 

Note that it is also possible to work with Zotero using a local client ([https://www.zotero.org/support/installation](https://www.zotero.org/support/installation)). This will allow you, for example, to install the Zotero connector in your web browser and may make the following steps easier (but it is not necessary either)\!

2. ### Join the DARIAH Zotero Group 

**The DARIAH Zotero Group is available at: [https://www.zotero.org/groups/744474/dariah](https://www.zotero.org/groups/744474/dariah)** (you might encounter other DARIAH related Zotero groups \- [https://www.zotero.org/search/type/group?q=dariah](https://www.zotero.org/search/type/group?q=dariah) \- but please use the above mentioned one).

Once you are logged in, visit the DARIAH Group and click on join, this will allow you to view and **edit** the records in the group. You only need to do this once. After joining, you can find the DARIAH group library in your personal library by logging into Zotero as per the above instructions.

 ![image3](../images/image6.jpg) 
 
*Joining the DARIAH Group*

3. ### Add publications to your national or WG folder

It’s crucial to curate the bibliographic data and pay specific attention to **‘DOI’ and ‘Rights’** metadata/field when you will fill out publications in your particular folder.

See Zotero documentation to understand how to manually add items to the Group Library: [https://www.zotero.org/support/adding\_items\_to\_zotero\#manually\_adding\_items](https://www.zotero.org/support/adding_items_to_zotero#manually_adding_items)

Go to the DARIAH Group Library: [https://www.zotero.org/groups/744474/dariah/library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/744474/dariah/library)

 ![image3](../images/image9.jpg) 
 
*DARIAH Group Library screenshot*

1. #### Adding publication via your browser with the Zotero connector

“The Zotero Connector's save button is the most convenient and reliable way to add items with high-quality bibliographic metadata to your Zotero library. As you browse the web, the Zotero Connector will automatically find bibliographic information on webpages you visit and allow you to add it to Zotero with a single click.” 

 ![image3](../images/image27.png) 
*Save to Zotero via the connector \- step 1*

 ![image3](../images/image4.png) 

*Save to Zotero via the connector \- step 2* 

#### 

2. #### Manually adding publication with identifier

It is also possible to add items manually via the DARIAH Zotero Library (i.e. without the connector).

If your resources have an Identifier \- ISBN, DOI, PubMed ID, arXiv ID, or ADS Bibcode \- it is really straightforward to add them to the library using this button ![][image14]\! This way, Zotero can also sometimes automatically identify resources based on a URL, e.g. to a publication page such as [this](https://journals.uio.no/dhnbpub/article/view/10650).

 ![image3](../images/image15.png) 

4. ### Manually adding publication without identifier

It is also possible to manually add items using the following button:  ![image3](../images/image1.png) 

If you have downloaded the client, you can also use the import functions to create a record.

5. ### Copying records from other libraries

Some countries \- it is the case for Italy or Germany for example \- or Working Groups are maintaining their own Zotero library. In this case, DARIAH related records can be copied directly between libraries. To do so, simply drag the selected record(s) from the source library to the target national/WG collection of the DARIAH Group Library (adding records to a new location will not remove them from the old one). If using Zotero online, you can also copy records by selecting the records you want to transfer, clicking the “Add to collection” button \ ![image3](images/image19.png) \] , and then selecting your country collection. 

6. ### Bulk imports

You can also import records in bulk, if these are stored in one of the many [bibliographic formats supported by Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/importing_standardized_formats). For this, you need to install the [Zotero desktop application](https://www.zotero.org/download/), and then click: File → “Import…” and choose “A file”.

*Tip*: if you are consolidating a list of references not very well structured, you might want to use the [AnyStyle](https://anystyle.io/) browser tool, that will help you to parse your bibliography before importing it.

7. ### Managing duplicated items

When your National references are collected and ready for the National Report, please manage the possible duplicated/triple items in your folder. You can only merge items from the same document type. If the duplicated items are of different types, you will have to choose the item or reference with the most metadata and updated one. 

5. ## DARIAH OpenAIRE Gateway {#dariah-openaire-gateway}

The [OpenAIRE Graph](https://graph.openaire.eu/) is an open access scholarly knowledge graph (SKG) resulting from the aggregation of research entity metadata records (properties and links) from thousands of scholarly communication data sources (institutional, thematic, data, software repositories, publisher archives, scientific databases, funder databases, etc.).

DARIAH OpenAIRE gateway [**https://dariah.openaire.eu/**](https://dariah.openaire.eu/), as a subset of the graph capturing DARIAH resources: publications, research data and software. This scope/perimeter of the gateway is defined by various dynamic filters/parameters (managed by the DCO team) applied on the overall research graph. Especially [zenodo communities](https://dariah.openaire.eu/participate/deposit/zenodo), [individual repositories](https://dariah.openaire.eu/search/find/dataproviders) or projects can be specified as sources for the gateway.

The present section introduces two main ways to add DARIAH resources to the OpenAire Community Gateway:

1. Via automated harvest of a data source by OpenAire   
   (and connecting it to the DARIAH Gateway)  
2. Via manually adding individual records 

In OpenAIRE context, **Data sources** are services from which OpenAIRE collects bibliographic metadata records, each describing a research product. Data sources are repositories, journals, publishers’ archives, PID authorities like Crossref and Datacite.

**Community of Gateway curators**

We invite nationals to provide the repository operator name (contact person)  to the managers (info@dariah.eu) of the DARIAH OpenAIRE gateway in order to collaboratively set up the inclusion or configuration of their data source in the gateway and be part of the DARIAH OpenAIRE gateway team.

1. ### Connect your data source to OpenAIRE and to the DARIAH Gateway (for services provider)

To automatically get the “research products” of a data source harvested by the OpenAire Research Graph, one needs to follow the [OpenAire PROVIDE guidelines](https://www.openaire.eu/openaire-guidelines-for-literature-institutional-and-thematic-repositories). 

It might mean that you have to upgrade your data source to make it compliant. Two main elements to take into consideration here: **implement an OAI-PMH endpoint**; **being compliant with the [OpenAire application profiles](https://openaire-guidelines-for-literature-repository-managers.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.0/application_profile.html)**. 

### To expose your repository's metadata records to comply with the OpenAIRE Guidelines v4.0, you will need to:

1. Follow the instructions for all the fields and populate all the mandatory fields and attributes.  
2. Populated Persistent Identifiers (eg. DOIs, handles for your research output).  
3. Populated ORCID iDs for authors/creators of the research products.  
4. Get funding data from OpenAIRE. Provide ‘DARIAH OpenAIRE manager’ information on Funders for your research products to see if they are incorporated into the OpenAIRE Graph. If not we get in touch with them to initiate the process.

**Configuration of Data sources[^8]**

To **focus on DARIAH content only**, you may use the filters functionality or the Advanced Criteria.

### **Menu: Content Configuration \--\> Data sources**

In some cases you want a subset of a specific data source. The EDIT OPTIONS allows you to specify filters. For example, we may want to include only products that have been published after a given date or published by a given publisher. 

A filter is composed of one field, one operator, and one value.

 ![image3](../images/image16.png) 

Different **fields** are available \- text field or controlled vocabulary field \- (abstract, author’s name, author’s ORCID, contributor, field of science, publication year, publisher, subject, Sustainable Development Goal, title) as well as **operators** on both textual and controlled vocabulary fields   (Contains; Equals; Not contains; Not equals;  Starts with).

In the example below of the Text Grid Repo, the filters are based on metadata identifying projects funded by DARIAH DE.

 ![image3](../images/image17.png) 

## 

## **Menu: Content Configuration \--\> Advanced Criteria**

In this section you can specify inclusion criteria in different fields and in combination. Go to Content Configuration \--\> Advanced Criteria to see the currently defined criteria.

 ![image3](../images/image21.png) 

Click on EDIT CRITERIA on the top right to make changes.

Click on “+ ADD CRITERION” on the bottom to add a new criterion. A criterion is composed of one or more constraints that need to be satisfied. If a research product satisfies a criterion, then it is added to the gateway.

The following fields are available: Abstract (text); Author’s name (text); Author’s ORCID (text); Contributor (text); Field of Science (controlled vocabulary); Publication Year (number, four digit); Publisher (text); Subject (text); Sustainable Development Goal (controlled vocabulary); Title (text)  as well as **operators** on both textual and controlled vocabulary fields (Contains; Equals; Not contains; Not equals;  Starts with).

** ![image3](../images/image16.png) **

## **Menu: Content Configuration \--\> Zenodo communities**

Zenodo communities are collections, typically curated by an expert. There are communities to collect papers of a journal, outputs of a project, research data of an organization, etc.

Every record deposited in a selected Zenodo community will be included in the gateway.

You may have a Zenodo community for your community: you can set it as “main Zenodo community”. It will be promoted on the Deposit page.

 ![image8](../images/image8.png) 

To add a new Zenodo community: Click on “+ NEW ZENODO COMMUNITY” to add a new one. Type a search term to find relevant Zenodo communities. If you find a relevant community, you can include it by clicking on ADD. If a main Zenodo community is not already set, you have the option to add it as a main community. When you are ready, click on DONE to save your changes.

 ![image28](../images/image28.png) 

2. ### Add individual records to DARIAH OpenAIRE Gateway (for researchers)

In case you cannot find your own outputs in the gateway, you can add it via the [**Link**](https://dariah.openaire.eu/participate/claim) **functionality**. There are three main steps to link your own data sets and other research outputs to the DARIAH gateway. 

- Sign up/sign in to [https://dariah.openaire.eu/](https://dariah.openaire.eu/)   
- Follow the 3 steps of the [**“Start linking functionality”**](https://dariah.openaire.eu/participate/claim) 

  1. #### Find sources. Add the DOI (or other PID) or title, author etc. of the resource and then click on ‘Search’.

 ![image20](../images/image20.png) 

Link sources to entities. Click on the ‘+’ symbol on the right side of the search result to move them to your basket and then click on Step 2 “Link sources to entities”. 

 ![image19](../images/image19.png) 

2. #### Then, select “Type”: Research products, Projects or Research Communities and enter your entity to link. 

The DARIAH Gateway is selected by default as **Research Community** but here you can link to other communities too. 

 ![image10](../images/image10.png) 

3. #### Summarize and finish. Click on “Confirm linking”
