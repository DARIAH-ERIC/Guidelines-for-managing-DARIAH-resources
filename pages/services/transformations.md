## DARIAH overlay journal \- Transformations

*Transformations. A DARIAH Journal* is a multilingual journal created in 2024 by DARIAH ERIC, and available at: [**https://transformations.episciences.org/**](https://transformations.episciences.org/). It publishes one issue per yearand offers the possibility for authors to submit a diversity of research outputs: research article, data paper and workflow paper. Both authors and reviewers can rely on some thorough [guidelines](https://transformations.episciences.org/for-authors#evaluation-and-guidelines) for submitting and assessing these different outputs

In *Transformations*, Arts and humanities researchers can publish in a transparent publishing model based on DIAMOND Open Access and Open Peer Review, for documenting different types of methodological and research activities (data gathering and processing, annotation, modelling, analysis and interpretation) as well as diverse and complex research outputs (the scholarly paper, the underlying data or other resources, software packages, training materials etc.).

An **overlay journal** is an innovative type of scholarly publication that operates on top of pre-existing data repositories. Unlike traditional journals, overlay journals do not host content themselves. Instead, they select, peer review and formally publish links to content that is already hosted on other platforms, such as [HAL](https://shs.hal.science/) , Zenodo or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) and [ARCHE](https://arche.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/browser/) (recently connected to Episciences). Articles, or any type of content that has been selected for publication, receives a proper citation and a digital object identifier (DOI), ​​making it possible for readers to reference and link to these documents reliably.

Step by step, the goal is for DARIAH to **connect DARIAH recommended repositories** to Episciences, enabling a wider number of repositories to feed into the overlay journal.
