DARIAH-Campus is both a *discovery framework* and a *hosting platform* for DARIAH and DARIAH-affiliated offerings in training and education. It is the central catalogue for training materials in the context of DARIAH

The goal of DARIAH-Campus is to widen access to open, inclusive, high-quality learning materials that aim to enhance creativity, skills, technology and knowledge in the digitally-enabled arts and humanities.

Within DARIAH-Campus, users can find different types of **learning resources:**

* external resources   
* hosted resources  
* pathfinders

and **captured outputs of face-to-face events** run by members of the community.
