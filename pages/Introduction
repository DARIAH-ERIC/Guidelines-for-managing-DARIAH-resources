# **Introduction** {#introduction}

The distributed and polymorphic nature of DARIAH as a consortium, and its social and technical components as an infrastructure makes it pertinent to define its perimeter. This is especially true with respect to the various resources that are created and used in its environment. The term ***“DARIAH resource”*** does not indicate direct ownership or control by the DARIAH consortium over that resource but rather it being **created and/or used within the broad DARIAH ecosystem**, i.e. some actor (person or institution) related to DARIAH being involved in the creation or provision of that resource. A large majority of DARIAH resources are produced or offered by individual institutions in the member countries and reported by their respective national consortia. Besides that, there are resources produced under DARIAH activities by DARIAH Working Groups, funded by DARIAH Theme or by DARIAH and affiliated entities within EU projects. 

For DARIAH, as an operational ERIC[^1] contributing to the European Open Science Cloud, a comprehensive inventory of the “ecosystem of resources” produced and used in the community is crucial to further build a “coherent RI ecosystem”[^2] for the benefit of researchers. This leads to: a) position DARIAH as a broker or knowledge hub spreading best practices within and between communities; b) improve the integration and/or interoperability of the resources, by identifying and closing incompatibility gaps. 

6 main DARIAH resource types are currently identified.

| Resource Type | Generic definition[^3] | DARIAH scope |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Publication | Research results published in academic journals or non-peer-reviewed publication repositories such as Zenodo. Example: [10.4000/jtei./4460](http://journals.openedition.org/jtei/4460)  | One of the following applies: result of work in a national consortium or working group funded by DARIAH-EU or a national consortium  a DARIAH-affiliated tool or resource is \*cited/used in them It is written/created by authors affiliated to DARIAH bodies or national consortia. it is about DARIAH/CLARIAH |
| Dataset | A dataset is a digital object or a collection of digital objects that is generally considered a distinctive body of work. Example: [https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/dataset/pNFLh2](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/dataset/pNFLh2) |  |
| Training Material | Tutorials, lessons or didactic resources with specific learning outcomes, e.g. explaining how to use a tool. Example: [https://campus.dariah.eu/resources/hosted/data-and-databases-from-source-to-data](https://campus.dariah.eu/resources/hosted/data-and-databases-from-source-to-data)  |  |
| Software | Source code or software package developed and/or used in a research context*Note:* In distinction to services, which are available as web applications or APIs and can be used directly, software needs to be downloaded and installed or executed on the side of the user, to be used. Example: [https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/tool-or-service/i6piia](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/tool-or-service/i6piia)  |  |
| Service | Web application or API which can be accessed online/via Internet. Example: [https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/tool-or-service/VjLUsM](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/tool-or-service/VjLUsM) | Service owned by DARIAH-ERIC, DARIAH partner institutions or coming from a DARIAH-related project. See Service policy for inclusion criteria. |
| Data source | A Data Source is a specific service that exposes metadata about different types of Digital Objects. Examples of data sources are repositories, digital libraries, scientific databases, catalogues, etc. Example: [HAL](https://hal.science/DARIAH) or [https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/tool-or-service/hqXyOo](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/tool-or-service/hqXyOo) |  |

*Fig 01: DARIAH resources conceptual view*		

To collect information about DARIAH Resources, specific "pathways” are proposed describing flow of information about different types of resources between existing components of the broader ecosystem. They allow us to gather existing information about the resources, from wherever it is already available, eliminating the need to enter the same information multiple times. The pathways are governed by two premises: 

1) make maximal use of existing infrastructure components (repositories, catalogues, registries, etc.), primarily in the EOSC context  
2) capture the breadth of the field, not disqualifying resources (esp. software and services) which may be not mature enough for the primary pathway. 

Individual pathways are detailed in the present *Guidelines for managing DARIAH resources*. While section 2 “DARIAH resources pathways” provides an overview of the pathways per resource types, section 3 “Services used for managing DARIAH resources” includes detailed guidelines on how to use the various services involved in all the pathways. 

Complementary to these Guidelines, there are a number of further relevant policy documents that govern the management of DARIAH resources, especially the DARIAH Services [^4]and DARIAH Data policy[^5].
