# **Conclusion** {#conclusion}

In these Guidelines to manage DARIAH resources, the various pathways to join the DARIAH ecosystem for any resource type are described (section 2\) and the use of different services involved in this ecosystem are explained (section 3\) in order to facilitate the management of DARIAH resources. 

Considering the evolving landscape \- emergence of innovative resources, improvement of the interoperability frameworks behind the registries \- the present guidelines require regular update. As such and to ensure a fully coherent picture of the DARIAH resources guidelines, the following next steps are currently \[as of December 2025 November 2024\] envisioned:

- Reconciliation of the data between the SSH Open Marketplace and the DARIAH OpenAire Gateway   
- Alignment with the new EOSC onboarding framework once known, probably in the beginning of 2025\.

The present guidelines will be updated accordingly.
